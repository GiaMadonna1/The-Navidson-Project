Take Two at the project. 

This is a one level maze puzzle game inspired by the book, "House of Leaves". Directions are pretty simple. You must start in the upper left hand corner (indicated by a red square) and end in the bottom right corner (indicated by another red square). The only objective is to choose the proper route, and make it to the end. Good Luck, Have Fun. 


Special shout out to Corey and Tomas for helping with roadblocks and getting this show back on the road. 



Future renditions could include making multiple levels that are harder, but first I'd need an algorithim because even 100 squares is pretty time consuming. In the peak of my CSS coding, the file was at 600 lines before refractoring. I would also add in a win game functionality that actually works instead of breaking my code.
